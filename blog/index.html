		It has been a while that I actually sit down to write something for someone else (and for myself :P).
		The recent phase I'm going through definitely feels fun, weird and unusual. From the care-free environment of college to the acutal 8-hour a day working, it's been quite hectic and lots of mixed emotions for me. I'm happy that so far so good. Life in Dubai is very comfortable and relaxing and I enjoy it so far :P

		# NAMSHI

  </div>
	<div>
		A startup that is bit too old & big to be a startup but still super flexible on tech updates and changes. I think this company might be among one of the COOLEST one in Dubai. Coolest meaning there has been 1) a sense of close-knit community (the leads are trying very hard to build one); 2) the super-young, energetic and fashionable culture; 3) remarkable business growth and expansion in the past few years.
	<br><br>
		I've been talking to people and trying to know more about this company and it is inspring to see how a simple business idea turns into a pretty giant thing within a short span of time (couple years?)

		Work life balance is extremely hard for me to achieve in this phase since I have been making new friends in and out of Namshi, and with my house mates. There are a wild range of different funky cultures going on. In company it is mostly serious and work-centric and after work it is funky shit and poi dance and cooking :P. Very hard for me to choose what to do after work: learn more tech stuff or just chill and have fun with friends?

		Gym has been amazing! Since my period came I'm probably not going to gym for couple days... but I'm so ready to start! Last week I worked on my butt, abs and some chest. I want to work on my chest and some shoulder next time :P
	<br><br>
		My ear is still huring as right now but I've been taking ear drops so far. Hopefully the pain will go away tomorrow!
	<br><br>
		Diggy cooked Mac & Cheese for me today and it was really amazing!! I watched how he did it so I can cook it next time too :P...
	<br><br>
		 Sidd told me a female friend of his said she was drugged by another friend of Sidd couple nights ago... Apparently this girl and the guy went to a club, drunk a lot and they drove above speed limit and drove into the airport... And the girl said he drugged her and she passed out twice? And the next day police came to them and gave them couple fines.. I was really shocked to hear the story and everyone seemed really concerned coz it seemed like the girl was sexually assaulted but I'm not sure. Very weird :/
	<br><br>
		Another weird thing happened in my company is that a colleague of my who is a Front-End Software Engineer absconded the country?! He wrote us an email saying that he has to go back to India because his grandpa passed away and he needed to be away for a week. But after a week he asked for another week. So our boss emailed him and some conversation happened between them and then it seemed like the colleague does not plan to come back to the country anymore?! It was very shocking news to everyone in the company too considering he just joined for a bit more than a month and has two cars in Dubai and has a wife in Dubai... We don't know really what happened but we think he might be in some sort of trouble.
	<br><br>
		Anyways! I'll write more tomorrow! Time to sleep zzzz
