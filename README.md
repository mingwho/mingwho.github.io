# Design Idea

So this is a personal portfolio website that showcases my artworks and aesthetics.

### Aesthetics

The vibe I want to pursue is something really Vaporwave. Something Clairo. Something Pilar Zeta. Some colors here and there in the middle of white, pink and blue.Â 

Style reference: ULTRAMAJIC. HIGH DEFEINITION images with quality, powerful contents.

  - Illustrations of imagery and identity that breaks through the definition of traditional beauty standards
