# Design Idea

The main page will be a portfolio site to show my projects.

There will also be a blog page open to public.

### Aesthetics

The vibe I want to pursue is vaporwavy, elegant and minimalist, something like Pilar Zeta.

Colors will be white, black, pink and blue.Â 


### Projects
Below are some of the projects I plan to show on this website

- Define Me
  - Imagery of identity that breaks through the definition of traditional beauty standards
- Valley of the Wind
  - Gliding in magical mountains and plant dreamy sound seeds in VR
- Illuminated
  - First person shooting game that explores the medium of light in VR
- Mediate
  - multi-player VR experience

### Framework & Stuff

- Google Analytics
- Modernizr
- TweenMax
- Maybe docker?
