      <description>If you are like me, you probably asked yourself &amp;quot;How to exit Vim?&amp;quot; at some point in your life.

So you probably have tried hitting that Esc, it doesn&#39;t work.
Ok what about the good old Ctrl + C... it doesn&#39;t respond.
Type quit + enter? Well, it does type &amp;quot;quit&amp;quot; with a new line ðŸ˜…

It turns out that this is a common question, because literally over one million developers have asked this question! Good to know that we are part of this global developer confusion right?
So how did I start learning it? I had the same confusion for the first 21 years of my life.</description>
