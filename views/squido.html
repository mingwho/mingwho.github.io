			<div class = 'blog_title'><h3> Time Management </h3></div>
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				Last month I started a subscription with Safari Books Online, O'Reilly's platform for technology and business learning. The subscription was quite expensive, around $400 a years, but it has loads of good content and I kept discovering useful books and videos on it.
			</div>
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				Today I finished reading my first lesson which is Time Management on Safari Books Online, and I want to share what I've learned to manage time!
			</div>

			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				1) First thing I should do is to clean up my workspace! This is quite unexpected advice right? I never thought a messy workspace would undermine productivitiy THAT MUCH, but out of curiosity, I cleaned up my desk. Turns out my productivity at least doubled! The only things on my desk now are a computer monitor, a mouse, a keyboard, a notebook, a speaker and a water bottle!
			</div>

			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				2) Second thing I learned is to identify the most important tasks! And to "major in the majors"! I have a habit of starting on something very enjoyable in the morning (read a book, play a game, chit chat with people, or gym!). The result of this habit is that I never get to spend enough time with the important task I actually need to do (work on my website, develop a game, etc). So I should give myself a sufficient incentive to do the most important task first! To align with this task, I figured that my current goals are to learn UE4 (a game engine for VR development) and to prepare for coding interviews (so I can apply to other jobs later)!
			</div>

			<div class = "blog_paragragh">
				3) Third point is to control interruptions! This is the hardest thing for me to do. It is hard for me to SAY NO if someone asks me to do something. Squido says always remember to put your own interests before anyone else's. I think this advice goes along here. Whenver someone wants to interrupt me with the task I'm working on, I should feel comfortable to tell him/ her that "I would love to do XXX with you but I have to get back to work because I need to get this done by XXX time". I didn't do this today. When Micky asked me to play game with him, I sat with him even though all the time I felt uncomfortable coz I really should do something more productive. Tomorrow I will be better at this and prioritize my needs first!
			</div>
			<div class = "blog_paragragh">
				That's the three points I learned! I'm so happy today I finished reading this book so fast and let's see where it will take me to :P!

			<div class = 'blog_title'><h3> UAE Road Trip </h3></div>
			<div class = 'blog_section'>
				# Dubai
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				This weekend, my Chinese squad and I decided to go on a road trip together. I've been craving to go to this restaurant (Samad Al Iraqi) forever and we decided to give it a shot. This Iraqi resturant is famous for making Maskouf, a Mesopotamian dish made of seasoned, grilled carp. The Maskouf was sold in kilos and we got one fish of 3 kilos! After half an hour of waiting, we got this beautiful and ginormous fish in front of us. I mean just look at it (compare with the fork and stuff)!

				# Sharjah
			</div>
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				After the meal, we departed to our next destination Shajah and we arrived at Waist Wetland Center to conduct some serious bird watching because all birds like to chill outdoors in the summer! We saw a lot of birds: flamingo, bee-eaters, lots of ducks, and some I can't name. And they are all so goooofy! They are like Becky and Ron. Look at this birdie running with a boy and that one standing up singing??

				# Umm Al Quwain and Ras Al-Khaimah
			</div>
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				At the last part of the day we went to Umm Al Quwain and visited a local museum! It was my first time visiting Umm Al Quwain and I have to say this place represents the pre-oil UAE. There was so few people and so few buildings. Even the municipality of Umm Al Quwain is smaller than any building of NYUAD. It feels like a peaceful old small town. We visited the old fort of the local museum and the bedrooms of the founding Sheikh and Sheikha (the rooms are very small too). But imagining people in the old days sleeping without AC in this heat... Damn...
			</div>
			<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				On the second day, we decided to go to a mountain in Ras Al-Khaimah and it was quite nice and surprisingly very few people were there. I had the chance to try the longest zip-line of the world but I freaked out a little bit so I didn't do it this time! It looked so fun, so I want to try it next time! After the mountain drive, we went to an Afghani restaurant and had tons of delicious goat meat! (Guess someone has to go to gym tomorrow :P) And that's a wrap!

				# NAMSHI (this is kinda techy?)
			</div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
					 Today I'm really really happy because I finished 90% of a task that was assigned to me this week! My task is to enable customers to update their language preference. Basically, Namshi sends out lots of emails and SMS everyday for marketing and notification reasons. And the app decides on the users' preferred language when they purchase an item. However, some users are receiving messages in antoher language that they don't want.
				</div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
					 For this task, I wrote both the back-end and the front-end during past few days. The funny thing is that I always think that back-end takes lots of thought and meticulous tuning and the front-end should just easy peasy lemon squicy. However I was very wrong :P
				</div>

				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
						I spent one day writing and testing the API and two days writing the Angular front-end. I have to admit Angular is the most confusing thing I have ever encountered in my coding life... because there are just so many things going on here and there and here and there and ALL OVER THE PLACE... Like mind-blowingly complicated. For example, to make a simple change like this one, I edited 9 files in the front end while in back end I only changed 1 :)
				</div>

				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
						Before I questioned why my boss (Alex) wanted to put me in the back-end team. Now I get it. Back-end is so much less painful. I'm still happy that I tried to write front-end this time. Feeling some super power right now haha

						GEEEEEZ!! This obsession with sneakers has been growing on me!! Every night I spend hours and hours from one app to another, from one website to anther, just staring at shoes. Can you imagine this?
				</div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				 But DAMN shoes are so cute.. I used to have friends who are obsessed with street culture and would stand for hours in line to buy the newest Yeezy and Bape shit and I just didn't get it, like they are JUST SHOES. But recently because Namshi kept sending me all these emails and promotions and updates on sneakers, I started looking at sneakers every single day. And they fukn look cuter and cuter every day... How did this happen?
				</div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				 	Hmmm I hereby announce that consumerism has devoured me. Sneakers can take my soul now :P
				</div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
				 	PS... my Ultraboost should arrive tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. My heart is overflown with joy.

			<div class = 'blog_title'><h3> First blog oh yeah </h3></div>
				<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
					It has been a while that I actually sit down to write something for someone else (and for myself :P).
					The recent phase I'm going through definitely feels fun, weird and unusual. From the care-free environment of college to the acutal 8-hour a day working, it's been quite hectic and lots of mixed emotions for me. I'm happy that so far so good. Life in Dubai is very comfortable and relaxing and I enjoy it so far :P

					<b># NAMSHI</b>
			  </div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
							A startup that is bit too old & big to be a startup but still super flexible on tech updates and changes. I think this company might be among one of the COOLEST one in Dubai. Coolest meaning there has been 1) a sense of close-knit community (the leads are trying very hard to build one); 2) the super-young, energetic and fashionable culture; 3) remarkable business growth and expansion in the past few years.
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
							I've been talking to people and trying to know more about this company and it is inspring to see how a simple business idea turns into a pretty giant thing within a short span of time (couple years?)
					  </div>
				<div class = 'blog_section'>
					<b># Life</b>
			  </div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
							Work life balance is extremely hard for me to achieve in this phase since I have been making new friends in and out of Namshi, and with my house mates. There are a wild range of different funky cultures going on. In company it is mostly serious and work-centric and after work it is funky shit and poi dance and cooking :P. Very hard for me to choose what to do after work: learn more tech stuff or just chill and have fun with friends?
					  </div>
			  <div class = 'blog_section'>
				  <b># Other random stuff</b>
			  </div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								Gym has been amazing! Since my period came I'm probably not going to gym for couple days... but I'm so ready to start! Last week I worked on my butt, abs and some chest. I want to work on my chest and some shoulder next time :P
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								My ear is still huring as right now but I've been taking ear drops so far. Hopefully the pain will go away tomorrow!
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								Diggy cooked Mac & Cheese for me today and it was really amazing!! I watched how he did it so I can cook it next time too :P...
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								 Sidd told me a female friend of his said she was drugged by another friend of Sidd couple nights ago... Apparently this girl and the guy went to a club, drunk a lot and they drove above speed limit and drove into the airport... And the girl said he drugged her and she passed out twice? And the next day police came to them and gave them couple fines.. I was really shocked to hear the story and everyone seemed really concerned coz it seemed like the girl was sexually assaulted but I'm not sure. Very weird :/
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								Another weird thing happened in my company is that a colleague of my who is a Front-End Software Engineer absconded the country?! He wrote us an email saying that he has to go back to India because his grandpa passed away and he needed to be away for a week. But after a week he asked for another week. So our boss emailed him and some conversation happened between them and then it seemed like the colleague does not plan to come back to the country anymore?! It was very shocking news to everyone in the company too considering he just joined for a bit more than a month and has two cars in Dubai and has a wife in Dubai... We don't know really what happened but we think he might be in some sort of trouble.
						</div>
						<div class = 'blog_paragragh'>
								Anyways! I'll write more tomorrow!
